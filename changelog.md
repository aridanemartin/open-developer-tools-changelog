### Technical Implementation

**Tab System Refactoring**

- Improved code maintainability by centralizing tab management logic.
- Enhanced tab system to be future-proof when adding or removing tabs.
- Updated all tab references to use semantic identifiers (`git-branch-generator`, `config`, etc.).
- Simplified tab structure by removing redundant `value` property, using only `id`.

**Playwright Test Organization**
- Reorganized Playwright tests by tab functionality for better maintainability.
- Created dedicated test folders for each tab: `GitBranchGenerator`, `QuickCopy`, `GitHubSearch`, `GithubBooster`, `PostMessageDebugger`, `Config`.
- Added generic app tests folder for cross-tab functionality tests.
- Updated test file naming from `task-branch.spec.ts` to `git-branch-generator.spec.ts` for consistency.
- Enhanced `ExtensionHelpers` with `navigateToTab()` method for easier tab-specific testing.
- Added comprehensive npm scripts for running tests by tab or functionality:
  - `npm run test:e2e:all` - Run all Playwright tests
  - `npm run test:e2e:app` - Run generic app tests
  - `npm run test:e2e:git-branch` - Run GitBranchGenerator tests
  - `npm run test:e2e:quick-copy` - Run QuickCopy tests
  - `npm run test:e2e:github-search` - Run GitHubSearch tests
  - `npm run test:e2e:github-booster` - Run GithubBooster tests
  - `npm run test:e2e:postmessage` - Run PostMessageDebugger tests
  - `npm run test:e2e:config` - Run Config tests
- Maintained backward compatibility by keeping `taskBranch` state property while using `git-branch-generator` for tab identification.
- Updated test data and validation to support the new organization structure.
- Added comprehensive documentation for the new test structure in `tests/e2e/specs/README.md`.
